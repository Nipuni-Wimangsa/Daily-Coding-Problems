<h2>Daily Coding Problem 2 [Hard - Uber]</h2>

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index <code> i</code> of the new array is
the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at <code> i</code>.

For example, if our input was <code> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, the expected output would be <code> [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]</code>. 
If our input was <code> [3, 2, 1]</code>, the expected output would be <code> [2, 3, 6]</code>
